/*
This is an example of the "ButtonMatrix" class of the MIDI_controller library.
Connect a 4 Ã— 3 matrix of buttons with the rows to pins 2, 3, 4 and 5, 
and the columns to pins 6, 7 and 8.
Pull-up resistors are not necessary, because the internal ones will be used. 

If you want to be able to press multiple buttons at once, add a diode 
in series with each button, as shown in the schematic on the Wiki:
https://github.com/tttapa/MIDI_controller/wiki/Hardware

The note numbers are specified in the 'addresses' array.
Map accordingly in your DAW or DJ software.
